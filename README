Game : Flappy bird 2.0

Project features: 

1. We can resize the bird for passing through narrow spaces (Bird gets into original shape automatically after 4 seconds)
2. We can change the number of enemies through menu section
3. Bird has to reach the end without colliding with pipes and he has to kill every butterfly
4. Number of pipes can be changed through the XML file

The easiest part of this project:
